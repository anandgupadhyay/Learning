//Extensions in Swift

//struct Person {
//    let firstName: String
//    let lastName: String
//}
//You can create an extension for this structure and add a fullName property:

//extension Person {
//    var fullName: String {
//        firstName + " " + lastName
//    }
//}
//In this case, we have access to the source code of the Person structure, so we could also decide to define the fullName computed property inside the struct itself:

//struct Person {
//    let firstName: String
//    let lastName: String
//    
//    var fullName: String {
//        firstName + " " + lastName
//        
//    }
//}

 Using if and Switch 
let result = if Bool.random() { 0 } else { 1 }

//Nice! But the feature has a limitation. When you use the ternary operator, you can place the whole expression in parentheses and then continue using the result.

let result = (Bool.random() ? 0 : 1) * 5

//But you can't do the same using if/switch statements as expressions.

//I have an easy trick to solve the limitation! The Value function!

func Value<T>(_ result: () -> T) -> T { result() }

//Now, you can place your statement inside Value's closure, and it will return the inferred Value you can continue working with.

let result = Value { if Bool.random() { 0 } else { 1 } } * 5

//It is an easy trick, but so useful!

// Example illustrating the Dry principle in Swift 5.7
//This Swift 5.7 example demonstrates the Dry principle using reusable functions, extensions, generics, and protocols with protocol extensions to avoid repetition, thereby promoting code efficiency and maintainability.

////greet(name: "Alice")
////greet(name: "Bob")

//    //My favorites way of using enums are using them with associated values, and computed variables to achieve the clean code level I am aiming to. But there can also be a situation when based on the switch result on the enum, we want to store it in some local variable. Previously, we needed to firstly initialize that value, and then to the switch to assign it. Now, it can all be done in a single expression ðŸš€
//    enum Suit: String {
//        case spades = "â™ "

//    }
//    
//    
//    func oldWay(enumval: Suit) -> String{
//        // Before
//        let localVariable: String

//            localVariable = "hearts"
//        default:
//            localVariable = "other"
//        }
//        return localVariable
//    }
//    
//    func newWay(enumval: Suit)-> String{
//        // Now
//        return switch enumval {
//        case .spades: "Spades"
//        case .hearts: "Heart"
//        case .clubs: "Clubs"
//        case .diamonds: "Dimonds"
//        }
//    }

//Let's delve into a detailed example of static variables and their usage, alongside a real-life scenario involving lazy variables in the context of an employee company case.
//
//Static Variables:
//
//Static variables in Swift belong to the type itself rather than to instances of that type. They're shared across all instances of the type and are typically used to store values or configurations that are common to all instances. While they're static in nature, they can still be mutable (hence the 'var' keyword).
//
//Example - Static Variable:
//
//Consider a class Employee representing employees in a company. Each employee has a unique employee ID, but the company might want to keep track of the total number of employees across all instances of the Employee class.
//
//
//
//class Employee {
//    var name: String
//    var employeeID: Int
//    static var totalEmployees: Int = 0 // Static variable to keep track of total employees
//    
//    init(name: String) {
//        self.name = name
//        self.employeeID = Employee.totalEmployees // Assign unique employee ID
//        Employee.totalEmployees += 1 // Increment total employees
//    }
//}
//
//// Example usage
//let emp1 = Employee(name: "John")
//let emp2 = Employee(name: "Jane")
//print(Employee.totalEmployees) // Output: 2




//In this example, totalEmployees is a static variable of the Employee class. It keeps track of the total number of employees created, regardless of how many instances of Employee are initialized.
//
//Lazy Variables:
//
//Lazy variables are properties whose initial values are not calculated until the first time they are accessed. They're particularly useful for delaying the initialization of properties until they're actually needed. This can be beneficial for optimizing memory usage and improving performance, especially when dealing with expensive computations or resources.
//
//Real-life Scenario - Lazy Variable:
//
//Consider a scenario where the company maintains a directory of employee profiles, including their contact information, job title, and department. Loading employee profiles from a database can be resource-intensive, especially if the directory is large. Here, lazy loading can help improve performance by deferring the loading of employee profiles until they're requested.
//
//
//class EmployeeDirectory {
//    lazy var employeeProfiles: [EmployeeProfile] = self.loadEmployeeProfiles()
//    
//    func loadEmployeeProfiles() -> [EmployeeProfile] {
//        // Simulated heavy operation to load employee profiles from database
//        print("Loading employee profiles from database...")
//        // Assume loading from a database and returning employee profiles
//        return [/ List of employee profiles /]
//    }
//}
//
//struct EmployeeProfile {
//    var name: String
//    var jobTitle: String
//    var department: String
//    // Additional properties...
//}
//
//// Example usage
//let directory = EmployeeDirectory()
//// Employee profiles are not loaded yet
//print("Accessing employee profiles...")
//let profiles = directory.employeeProfiles // Lazy loading triggered here
//
//
//
//In this scenario, employeeProfiles is a lazy variable of the EmployeeDirectory class. The loadEmployeeProfiles() method is only executed the first time employeeProfiles is accessed. Subsequent accesses retrieve the previously loaded profiles without reloading them from the database.
//
//This approach optimizes memory usage and startup time, as employee profiles are only loaded when needed, rather than upfront during initialization.
//
//By combining static and lazy variables, you can effectively manage shared resources and optimize performance in your Swift applications.
